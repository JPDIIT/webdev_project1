  <h1>A Quick Reference for Amateur Astronomy</h1>
  <h2>Telescopes</h2>
  <p>There are three main types of telescopes, based on their optics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refractors</li>
    <li>Reflectors</li>
    <li>Catadioptrics</li>
  </ul>
  <div><img src="images/refractor1.svg" alt="Diagram of a refracting telescope, showing light paths and focus point"></div>
  <p>Refractors are what the average person thinks of when imagining a telescope. They use a glass lens near the front of the tube to bend and focus
  light to a point at the back, where a lens in the eye-piece focuses it further. A mirror or prism can also bend the light at an angle into the eye-piece
  for the ergonomics of the observer. Refractors are more common for smaller, introductory-level telescopes, since the cost of making larger lenses quickly
  becomes prohibitive for the amateur market beyond around five inches in diameter. One could say that their prices are astronomical.</p>
  <div><img src="images/reflector1.svg" alt="Diagram of a reflecting telescope, showing light paths and focus point"></div>
  <p>Reflectors are much less common, but are useful for serious amateur astronomers who operate on a limited budget. Typically, a concave mirror at the back 
  of the tube focuses light to another mirror near the front. This mirror then reflects light into the eye-piece, which is often near the front of the tube.
  Newtonian reflectors are the most common type of reflecting telescope. They are also typically the least expensive and lowest maintenance.</p>
  <p>Catadioptric telescopes use a combination of reflecting and refracting optics. There is a wide variety of catadioptric designs, from the notoriously
  unreliable "Bird-Jones," to the powerful and compact (but expensive) "Schmitt-Cassegrain." The two main benefits to catadioptric designs are mutual problem 
  correction between reflector and refractor designs, and bending the light focusing path back over itself to pack a longer focal length into a shorter tube.
  The cheapest models are so unreliable as to be mostly useless, and the more reliable designs can be so expensive as to be cost prohibitive. Don't buy one 
  unless you know what you're doing, and don't try to build one unless you're a professional.</p>
  <p>All tubes sit on one of two main types of mounts, based on how they turn:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alt-Azimuth</li>
    <li>Equatorial</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alt-azimuth mounts are the easiest to operate and most intuitive to understand. They turn the scope up or down and left or right. The simplicity of
  this type of mount is reflected in how inexpensive it can be. A favorite design of amateur astronomers is the "Dobsonian Telescope," a Newtonian reflector 
  that sits on an alt-azimuth mount. The design maximizes power while minimizing expense, by using a simple rocker box that sits on a turntable, all of which
  moves and stops with the friction of simple teflon bearings. Enormous telescopes with apertures up to four feet wide, and tube assemblies 20 feet long can be
  easily moved by hand, albeit by an operator who is standing on a ladder. Amateurs have been perfecting the design for over three generations. If there's 
  anything that could be called an "open source telescope," this is it.</p>
  <p>Equatorial mounts are more complex and expensive, but they can find and track astronomical objects much more easily. Before use, the mount must first set 
  its "polar alignment." In the Northern Hemisphere, this is set by pointing the telescope to the North Celestial Pole (found near Polaris, the "North Star.") 
  In the Southern Hemisphere, the process is more complicated (since there is no "South Star") but still achievable with some effort and practice. One axis of 
  the mount rotates parallel to the pole, while the other is perpindicular to it. The scope has to be balanced by counter-weights to keep the balance point on
  the polar axis. Many equatorial mounts are motorized to aid in consistent tracking. When an astronomical object is sighted, the mount's polar axis rotates 
  the scope counter to the rotation of the Earth, keeping the object in constant view. This is a necessity for long-exposure astrophotography, or digital frame 
  stacking algorithms that require long videos of an object.</p>
  <h2>Astronomical Coordinate Systems</h2>
  <p>There are two main coordinate systems that are useful to astronomers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Horizontal</li>
    <li>Equatorial</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They correspond directly with the axis pairs of the two main types of telescope mounts, and this is not coincidental. Horizontal coordinates are altitude and 
  azimuth, which correspond with the altitude and azimuth axes of alt-azimuth mounts. Equatorial coordinates are right ascension and declination, and these correspond
  with the equatorial mount's polar axis and the axis which is perpendicular to it, respectively.</p>

  <h2>Obligatory Resume Link</h2>
  <p>This is not relevant to astronomy. However, it is not only relevant to this project, but a requirement of it. Nevertheless, I also submit this 
  <a href="resume.html">resume</a> as proof of the fact that I am a true amateur when it comes to astronomy. Not surprisingly, my professional background is in 
  the Information Technology field. When one is stuck inside all day, it's easier to be outside all night.</p>
